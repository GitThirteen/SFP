# Sandbox
A repository containing most if not all my small fun projects. The project description is in alphabetical order.<br>
For program executing instructions, refer to the README file in the corresponding folder.

### BadApple 
![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)<br>
<b>`STATUS`</b> `Completed`
<br>
<br>
Jumping on the "But can it play Bad Apple?" meme train as seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB7D76D426B628188) (check it out, it's really fun), I've written my own version of it in TypeScript. The program reads the gif that is placed in the /assets folder and displays it in the console.<br>
It should technically work with other gifs as well, just make sure that it's small enough so the console doesn't start lagging behind.
